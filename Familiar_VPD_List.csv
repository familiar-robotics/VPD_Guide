An almost certainly incomplete table of vision systems and processors that include some sort of additional on-device image processing capability vs those that simply firehose image data at you. This also includes processor boards/SOMs that have a socket/connector for a camera but don't come with one by default. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1 - USB3.0 is the primary interface on most models, IOT & OEM versions may have UART, PoE, etc. available for interfacing as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2. No default sensor included, user selects from a set of vendor-provided ""kit"" options at purchase.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3 - Most common NN models/frameworks supported via converter/compile toolchain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4 - Rolling shutter seems to be default. Global shutter is available either on a separate plug-in module or via different camera sensor module as a separate purchase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5 - Different HW interfaces available as option boards which can be purchased separately,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6. Not available for purchase as of 3/23 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
7 - Does not come with a camera/vision sensor by default. Features CSI/MIPI FPC interface for user-provided sensor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8. Available on pre-order,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"9. Default voltage is listed, usually via USB3, other options like POE may be available on different models and use a 24/48/57V power injector at the host end. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10. See interface spec for actual device power requirements.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
