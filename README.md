A collaborative comparison chart for Vision Processing Devices. 
To note:
  - This is not meant to be exhaustive but rather highlight the sensors and devices that come across my inbox/social media feed. It's actually impossible to keep track of all the "Intelligent" Cameras out there. There are way too many cropping up way too quickly, especially small ESP-32-like devices that can do face recognition, or run a reduced version of ImageNet which recognizes 5 or 10 objects. One defining characteristic of this product vertical is how easy it can be for fabs and design houses to iterate out new, often purpose-specific cameras and processors. 

Rather, I'm trying to keep track of devices and systems that come across my notice, while trying encouraging the reporting from others about what they're using, making or getting marketing blurbs about themselves.
